# WMO NFCS Operationalization: Interactive Courseware Design

## 💡 Project Summary

This repository contains the design and prototype files for the **National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) Operationalization** e-Learning course, developed as a portfolio submission for the WMO E-Learning Consultant position.

The design shifts the focus from theoretical knowledge to **practical decision-making under resource constraints**. The goal is to equip NMHS personnel with the ability to diagnose NFCS gaps and implement sustainable service delivery strategies.

## 🌟 Key Design Innovations for High-Impact Learning

The course adheres to the WMO's requirement for "innovative and visually appealing" content by integrating two high-fidelity interactive modules:

### 1. Strategic Resource Allocation Simulation (Module 3)

* **Objective:** To build competence in executing strategic trade-offs central to NFCS operation.
* **Mechanism:** Learners engage with an **Interactive Dashboard Interface** where they distribute limited **Budget, Personnel, and Technology** resources onto prioritized NFCS gaps.
* **Outcome:** Decision impacts are immediately quantified and visualized through **animated gauges**, simulating the real-world effect on critical sectors like **Water** and **Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)**.

### 2. Visualizing Sustainable Service Delivery (Module 4)

* **Objective:** To operationalize the abstract concepts of the User Interface Platform (UIP) and Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E).
* **Mechanism:** UIP strategies are presented as a **Cyclical Feedback Loop Infographic** to illustrate continuous service improvement.
* **M&E Integration:** Key performance indicators are integrated into **interactive scorecards and comparison charts** for hands-on application, eliminating reliance on static checklists.
